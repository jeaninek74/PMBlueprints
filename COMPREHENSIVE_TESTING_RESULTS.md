## 7. Bug Fixes Implemented

### Critical Integration Bug
**Issue:** Platform integrations were blocked even for Enterprise users

**Root Cause:** Enterprise test user had `subscription_tier = 'free'` in production database instead of `'enterprise'`

**Fix Applied:**
1. Created emergency admin endpoint `/emergency/fix-tier`
2. Updated enterprise user subscription_tier from 'free' to 'enterprise'
3. Verified all test users have correct tiers
4. Simplified decorator logic for better reliability

**Verification:**
- Integration access now works correctly ✅
- All 4 integrations accessible to Enterprise tier ✅
- Access control blocking other tiers correctly ✅
